# 30d3 - M8ST3R

## Things to remember:

* This is a little test project to learn more about security implementations in Nodejs
  * Pretty much just grabbed powershell statements and ran them in their own perspective functions. Nothing cool going on tbh.
* I will be turning this into a penetration testing framework in the future allowing me to remotely secure (or break) my computers and applications (or a clients)
  * For now this is very much in 'beta' and is a poorly designed POC - Sorry not sorry!
* I will only work on this when I feel like it. 
* If you'd like to take it and do something with it feel free to do so. * INFO SHOULD BE FREE F****ERS *
  * My work here will ALWAYS be free <3
* FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES **ONLY**
* I'll write better documentation later - sorry!
* **Open for collaboration and/or work**

###### Also, it's probably messy. This was for me to play around with - not a production implementation by ANY means lol  ;)
